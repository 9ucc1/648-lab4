1,The Beginning of the End,1,1,Have you ever woken up and wondered
2,The Beginning of the End,1,2,Where you are and why you're naked?
3,The Beginning of the End,1,3,You are now listening to Headache
4,The Beginning of the End,1,4,I used to take my breakfast off of a mirror
5,The Beginning of the End,1,5,Now I just walk around and stare at people in the park
6,The Beginning of the End,1,6,You think I care about what's happening to me?
7,The Beginning of the End,1,7,Even my demons have demons
8,The Beginning of the End,1,8,"When I last saw Monica, she told me"
9,The Beginning of the End,1,9,She never wanted to see or speak to me ever again in her life
10,The Beginning of the End,1,10,"She doesn't get it, nobody gets it"
11,The Beginning of the End,1,11,I can't remember the last time I got a good night's sleep
12,The Beginning of the End,1,12,"If you really think about it, life shouldn't feel this strange"
13,The Beginning of the End,1,13,If I could just figure out what the old woman wearing
14,The Beginning of the End,1,14,That salmon pink snakeskin jacket wants from me
15,The Beginning of the End,1,15,I'd feel a whole lot better
16,The Beginning of the End,1,16,Doesn't she have a job?
17,The Beginning of the End,1,17,Do I have a job?
18,The Beginning of the End,1,18,It's not normal to sit outside someone's apartment the whole night long
19,The Beginning of the End,1,19,"But then again, what is normal?"
20,The Beginning of the End,1,20,Do you think I'm normal?
21,The Beginning of the End,1,21,Say I'm normal
22,The Beginning of the End,1,22,"Please, for fuck's sake, please say I'm normal"
23,The Beginning of the End,1,23,I don't know what you want from me
24,The Beginning of the End,1,24,I could never do that contemplation shit
25,The Beginning of the End,1,25,Someone told me once that if you have more than three major concussions
26,The Beginning of the End,1,26,"Before the age of seven, you're fucked, I had eight"
27,The Beginning of the End,1,27,"And anyway, I'm not interested in knowing"
28,The Beginning of the End,1,28,"I'm just tired, so tired"
29,The Beginning of the End,1,29,Something went wrong
30,The Beginning of the End,1,30,Something went really wrong a long way back
31,The Beginning of the End,1,31,"And now I don't know, now I'm just doing this"
32,The Beginning of the End,1,32,"One morning you wake up, and you want to shave your head"
33,The Beginning of the End,1,33,Because the insects living up there
34,The Beginning of the End,1,34,Have started to throw parties they aren't inviting you to
35,The Beginning of the End,1,35,And you tell me I'm crazy?
36,The Beginning of the End,1,36,"I just want to live, I just want to feel something"
37,The Beginning of the End,1,37,"Anything, anything"
38,The Beginning of the End,1,38,There's so much in the world
39,The Beginning of the End,1,39,"There's good, bad, mad, sad, ugly, happy"
40,The Beginning of the End,1,40,But I just love beauty
41,The Beginning of the End,1,41,"I think about my friends sometimes, their lives, their failures"
42,The Beginning of the End,1,42,"They don't know where I am, I wonder if they miss me"
43,The Beginning of the End,1,43,"I miss their stories, the stuff they leave unfinished"
44,The Beginning of the End,1,44,"The words they leave behind, the good they drag after them"
45,The Beginning of the End,1,45,And the destruction they create
46,The Beginning of the End,1,46,"But above all, above All"
47,The Beginning of the End,1,47,I remember the love
48,The Beginning of the End,1,48,I remember sitting on my uncle Mario's knee
49,The Beginning of the End,1,49,While he told me about the man he killed in the Embarcadero in August 1999
50,The Beginning of the End,1,50,I remember the girl with pigtails in her hair asking me
51,The Beginning of the End,1,51,Why I looked so sad when I was supposed to be feeling happy
52,The Beginning of the End,1,52,I remember climbing on a statue in my grandmother's garden
53,The Beginning of the End,1,53,While serious guys in suits walked around talking to each other
54,The Beginning of the End,1,54,There was a lot of blood around back then
55,The Beginning of the End,1,55,"A lot of laughter, but a lot of blood too"
56,The Beginning of the End,1,56,And I mistook laughter for love
57,The Beginning of the End,1,57,I forgot the colour where I came from
58,The Beginning of the End,1,58,Now my taste is me
59,The Beginning of the End,1,59,And sometimes it's a little too sour
60,The Beginning of the End,1,60,The streets are so dead
61,The Beginning of the End,1,61,How is it so easy to leave this world behind?
62,The Beginning of the End,1,62,It feels like the world's a dream
63,The Beginning of the End,1,63,Right up until I remember the smell of her hair blowing in the wind
64,The Beginning of the End,1,64,You aimed for my eyes
65,The Beginning of the End,1,65,But you forgot that the heart is where all the action is
66,The Beginning of the End,1,66,This one goes out to all the ghosts
67,The Beginning of the End,1,67,I love you
68,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,1,Make some noise right now for the voices in your head
69,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,2,The thing is
70,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,3,I'm not just a nose with legs
71,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,4,But the desire to fall in is so strong
72,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,5,Listen to me
73,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,6,Do you need some lip balm?
74,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,7,I shouldn't be responsible for what I say
75,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,8,Someone else should be responsible for what I say
76,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,9,There will always be baskets and benches
77,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,10,The cow is for land and the horse is for water
78,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,11,But can you really feel the sound of two hundred people eating?
79,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,12,I was in ancient egypt with the rabbit
80,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,13,I saw the whole thing
81,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,14,I exist like cocaine
82,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,15,And I just wish stuff would stop happening so fast
83,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,16,I just want to catch my breath and feel that I exist in a moment
84,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,17,Within a moment
85,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,18,Inside this time right now
86,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,19,But I know life doesn't work like that
87,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,20,Everything is changing all the time
88,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,21,And if I keep eating this delusional garbage
89,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,22,It'll stick to the roof of my mouth
90,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,23,And I'll be walking along the street trying to go to the bank
91,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,24,Or something
92,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,25,And my tongue will be doing bits and my phone will ring
93,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,26,And it's someone calling themselves grandma
94,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,27,Which is weird because all my grandmas are dead
95,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,28,God rest their souls
96,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,29,But she's telling me about the fact she's taken a plane to Algeria
97,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,30,And she doesn't know why and I'm so baffled I walk into a lamp post
98,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,31,And on the other side of the street
99,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,32,Is the most beautiful woman in the world
100,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,33,And she's laughing at me
101,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,34,And everyone is staring at you
102,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,35,But not in a good way
103,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,36,In that scary way that you sometimes get in those dreams
104,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,37,Where everyone is looking at you
105,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,38,And you look down at your feet and you realise they aren't
106,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,39,Strictly speaking
107,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,40,Feet
108,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,41,But what are you supposed to do
109,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,42,"Because, because you just walked into a fucking lamppost"
110,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,43,And now you're rolling around on the floor
111,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,44,And you'll still trying to get the dang words out of your mouth
112,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,45,But they're stuck to your tongue
113,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,46,And the music playing in the car
114,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,47,Which the beautiful woman is getting into
115,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,48,Sounds a lot like an album you used to listen to
116,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,49,When you were younger
117,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,50,That soundtracked some of your first sexual experiences
118,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,51,And the car is maroon
119,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,52,And maybe that's actually exactly the same colour that your car is
120,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,53,And you start to get really freaked out
121,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,54,Because your head has been on the floor for a long time now
122,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,55,And if it starts to get any longer
123,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,56,There may be some major social and medical implications.
124,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,57,And so you start to feel a little bit funny all over
125,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,58,And you try to reach down to touch your toes
126,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,59,But your lips start to tingle
127,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,60,Because they are right there
128,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,61,Resting up against a pile of all your hopes and dreams
129,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,62,And there's the ambulance
130,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,63,And there are some nice concerned looking faces
131,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,64,Ready to take you somewhere
132,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,65,Where stuff will be injected into your central nervous system
133,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,66,Using techniques which seem to revolve
134,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,67,Around getting the ghost of your aunts mother-in-law
135,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,68,To sing lullabies in a language you don't understand
136,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,69,Until you really
137,That Thing with the Rabbit,2,70,Really start to forget who and what you are
138,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,1,Have you ever woken up one day and realised
139,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,2,That everything you thought you knew was wrong?
140,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,3,That every single decision you have ever made
141,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,4,In your entire life
142,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,5,Was also wrong?
143,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,6,Well I have
144,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,7,And it feels really good.
145,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,8,You don't need to sleep in your bed every night
146,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,9,The street is just as comfortable
147,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,10,Life is not all
148,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,11,You know
149,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,12,Funky shit and funny faces that you pull in the mirror.
150,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,13,It's deep
151,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,14,But it's not that deep
152,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,15,The blue skies are for good vibes
153,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,16,The grey skies are for when you want to die
154,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,17,There is nothing darker than the sunlight
155,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,18,When your eyes are closed.
156,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,19,"Trust me, I know,"
157,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,20,"I wear my sunglasses in the shower,"
158,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,21,And I'm starting to feel a whole lot better.
159,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,22,Life gave me love and I made life out of it.
160,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,23,My head hurts but my heart knows the truth.
161,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,24,I've remembered how to laugh again.
162,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,25,I've become irresistible to the people
163,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,26,To whom I want to be irresistible.
164,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,27,I know that love is the only thought and pain is the only feeling.
165,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,28,I know now that everything will work out for us.
166,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,29,We will occupy spaces.
167,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,30,We will make sounds.
168,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,31,We will go absolutely fucking crazy
169,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,32,We will think thoughts that will be thoughts
170,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,33,"We would have never imagined we could think,"
171,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,34,Not in any past that any thought of ours could ever reach
172,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,35,"But thoughts whispering the first glimpse of a future where somebody,"
173,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,36,"Maybe you, maybe not,"
174,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,37,"But somebody in a high, bright place"
175,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,38,Somebody wondering whether or not to jump
176,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,39,"Decides, at last,"
177,The Pavement is my Pillow Talk,3,40,That the only thing left to do is dance
178,Business Opportunities,4,1,"It was mostly peaceful, chaotic"
179,Business Opportunities,4,2,But mostly peaceful chaos.
180,Business Opportunities,4,3,I took my shoes off.
181,Business Opportunities,4,4,I got ready with how I was feeling.
182,Business Opportunities,4,5,"I ate the apple,"
183,Business Opportunities,4,6,And lost myself to paradise.
184,Business Opportunities,4,7,But the thing they don't tell you
185,Business Opportunities,4,8,"Is that it's your body that leaves your soul,"
186,Business Opportunities,4,9,Not the other way round.
187,Business Opportunities,4,10,You can literally feel your heart stop beating
188,Business Opportunities,4,11,And it's not
189,Business Opportunities,4,12,It's not even that strange
190,Business Opportunities,4,13,You know what's going to happen
191,Business Opportunities,4,14,But you aren't angry that you do know
192,Business Opportunities,4,15,And in fact the fact that you do know
193,Business Opportunities,4,16,Gives you some secret feeling of bliss
194,Business Opportunities,4,17,"And it's not, in any way, diminished,"
195,Business Opportunities,4,18,When that thing that you know is going to happen
196,Business Opportunities,4,19,Does eventually happen.
197,Business Opportunities,4,20,That's how I felt.
198,Business Opportunities,4,21,"I felt happy,"
199,Business Opportunities,4,22,In a secret way
200,Business Opportunities,4,23,"Naked obviously,"
201,Business Opportunities,4,24,Angry that I could hear voices
202,Business Opportunities,4,25,"But really,"
203,Business Opportunities,4,26,I was at peace with everything
204,Business Opportunities,4,27,Just me and my slowly slowing heart
205,Business Opportunities,4,28,And a crowd of faces asking me for my name
206,Business Opportunities,4,29,And what the date was
207,Business Opportunities,4,30,And whether or not we were in a time of national crisis.
208,Business Opportunities,4,31,"I don't know, kindness is so strange"
209,Business Opportunities,4,32,Ashamed doesn't really capture the feeling
210,Business Opportunities,4,33,You know
211,Business Opportunities,4,34,How it felt to be in front of them like that
212,Business Opportunities,4,35,Blinking like a cat who just found out
213,Business Opportunities,4,36,The mouse he's been trying to kill for the last ten years
214,Business Opportunities,4,37,Just ate his last piece of cheese
215,Business Opportunities,4,38,The only strange thing was that I could see
216,Business Opportunities,4,39,"Anything at all, let alone their faces"
217,Business Opportunities,4,40,I definitely wasn't supposed to be seeing anything
218,Business Opportunities,4,41,Dimitri had promised me I wouldn't.
219,Business Opportunities,4,42,I felt very very cold.
220,Business Opportunities,4,43,It gets cold up there in the winter.
221,Business Opportunities,4,44,Even colder if you've got nothing on.
222,Business Opportunities,4,45,I remember saying that I hadn't taken much
223,Business Opportunities,4,46,"Which was a lie, of course."
224,Business Opportunities,4,47,They were all looking at me
225,Business Opportunities,4,48,Like I was the perfect example
226,Business Opportunities,4,49,Of everything that was wrong with men in general
227,Business Opportunities,4,50,And my generation in particular
228,Business Opportunities,4,51,Why was the first thing I said
229,Business Opportunities,4,52,When I came back an incredibly obvious lie?
230,Business Opportunities,4,53,I guess that says a lot about me doesn't it.
231,Business Opportunities,4,54,God it was miserable.
232,Business Opportunities,4,55,"I remember them asking me if I had anywhere to stay,"
233,Business Opportunities,4,56,And me pausing for way too long
234,Business Opportunities,4,57,While knowing that the answer was obviously no
235,Business Opportunities,4,58,"And then saying no,"
236,Business Opportunities,4,59,And how terribly quiet they all got standing there
237,Business Opportunities,4,60,Staring at me
238,Business Opportunities,4,61,On that very cold winter morning
239,Business Opportunities,4,62,"This one goes out to the concept of luck,"
240,Business Opportunities,4,63,That pure blind luck
241,Business Opportunities,4,64,That makes the womens netball team
242,Business Opportunities,4,65,"Walk back a different route around the meadows,"
243,Business Opportunities,4,66,"A route that takes them past whatever I was at that point,"
244,Business Opportunities,4,67,That kind of luck.
245,Business Opportunities,4,68,"Monica brought that fact up to me, later,"
246,Business Opportunities,4,69,"While I was lying in her bed,"
247,Business Opportunities,4,70,Trying to figure out
248,Business Opportunities,4,71,If there was a way to intercept the suicide notes
249,Business Opportunities,4,72,I had mailed to ten different international news media conglomerates.
250,Business Opportunities,4,73,"She said, a little too triumphantly I think"
251,Business Opportunities,4,74,That if she hadn't ordered that eighth round of shots
252,Business Opportunities,4,75,Then they would have left early and I wouldn't have been there
253,Business Opportunities,4,76,"And that if she hadn't decided,"
254,Business Opportunities,4,77,In her
255,Business Opportunities,4,78,"As I was soon to discover,"
256,Business Opportunities,4,79,"Classically whimsical way, to lead the gang"
257,Business Opportunities,4,80,After that eighth round of shots back around a different way
258,Business Opportunities,4,81,"Just because she felt like it,"
259,Business Opportunities,4,82,Then she wouldn't have found me at all.
260,Business Opportunities,4,83,She found that that was all very relevant.
261,Business Opportunities,4,84,"So do I, I guess"
262,Business Opportunities,4,85,"When we slept together that night, for the first time,"
263,Business Opportunities,4,86,I saw stars.
264,Business Opportunities,4,87,It was beautiful
265,Business Opportunities,4,88,"So yeah,"
266,Business Opportunities,4,89,This one goes out to luck
267,Business Opportunities,4,90,And drunk mad women...
268,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,1,Beautiful things
269,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,2,Beautiful people
270,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,3,This is what it's all about.
271,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,4,"If you think the world looks good,"
272,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,5,Guess what
273,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,6,It does
274,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,7,"The Arctic Tern travels an average of 71, 000 kilometres a year"
275,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,8,"And though fish are not animals,"
276,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,9,They do have feeling
277,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,10,So think about that the next time you take a shit in the sea
278,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,11,I have no obligation to say I love you if you say you love me
279,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,12,It's not my fault that you love me
280,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,13,It's not anybody's fault
281,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,14,That love is the only thought
282,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,15,And pain is the only feeling
283,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,16,If you ask me that doesn't sound like such a bad situation
284,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,17,Existence is innocent
285,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,18,Please don't try to think otherwise
286,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,19,So charge it to the game and blame it on the DJ
287,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,20,That fell asleep at the decks
288,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,21,At this point I feel like I'm almost 100% pure angel
289,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,22,"My history starts right now, and I'm sorry for being late again"
290,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,23,I just didn't know that I had to be on time
291,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,24,Every single time
292,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,25,I really did love you

294,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,27,I wish you all the best in your life
295,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,28,And I'm sorry for always trying
296,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,29,To see the funny side
297,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,30,It just made everything in my life easier
298,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,31,People need to stop trying to be cool
299,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,32,And they need to start trying to be hot
300,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,33,Because remember
301,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,34,The enemy is yourself posed as a question.
302,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,35,"I don't know much about anything really,"
303,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,36,But I do know how life makes me feel:
304,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,37,It makes me feel both dead and alive
305,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,38,Just not at the same time
306,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,39,But you know what the weirdest part is?
307,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,40,Of all the onions in the world
308,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,41,I like spring onions the best
309,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,42,They give me hope
310,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,43,"Everything I said was True,"
311,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,44,Apart from that last part
312,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,45,"And although the head hurts,"
313,Truisms 4 Dummies,5,46,The heart Knows the truth
314,Bucket Listener,6,1,I don't recognise my face anymore
315,Bucket Listener,6,2,Was it always this strange looking?
316,Bucket Listener,6,3,Why can't I just live?
317,Bucket Listener,6,4,Why do I have to be this way?
318,Bucket Listener,6,5,I just want to be a person again
319,Bucket Listener,6,6,I just want to feel real again
320,Bucket Listener,6,7,I want to crack jokes
321,Bucket Listener,6,8,And dance under the stars with my friends again.
322,Bucket Listener,6,9,I would like to bankrupt the casino accidentally
323,Bucket Listener,6,10,There's so much I still want to do.
324,Bucket Listener,6,11,I want to hit the road with you again:

326,Bucket Listener,6,13,"Cairo, Cape Town, Bangkok"
327,Bucket Listener,6,14,"Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Bangkok again"
328,Bucket Listener,6,15,Cartagena for ceviche and a swim.
329,Bucket Listener,6,16,I want to watch you sleeping
330,Bucket Listener,6,17,And get high off how beautiful you are.
331,Bucket Listener,6,18,"I don't want this life anymore,"
332,Bucket Listener,6,19,I don't want to see that big black dog
333,Bucket Listener,6,20,In the corner of my room every night.
334,Bucket Listener,6,21,"I want to tan naked with you right next to me,"
335,Bucket Listener,6,22,Also naked.
336,Bucket Listener,6,23,I want to feel peace.
337,Bucket Listener,6,24,I want to see you in the black dress again
338,Bucket Listener,6,25,With your hair up
339,Bucket Listener,6,26,Looking at me
340,Bucket Listener,6,27,Telling me that you think we shouldn't pay
341,Bucket Listener,6,28,For the meal we just had because it really wasn't very good
342,Bucket Listener,6,29,It's time
343,Bucket Listener,6,30,My head hurts but I know what I have to do.
344,Bucket Listener,6,31,I need to stop being cool and start being hot
345,Bucket Listener,6,32,I need to mix the blue with the yellow
346,Bucket Listener,6,33,I need to call her back
347,Bucket Listener,6,34,I know what to say when the robot asks me for my name.
348,Bucket Listener,6,35,I know that love is the only thought
349,Bucket Listener,6,36,And pain is the only feeling
350,Mission Impossible III,7,1,This is the sound of orange juice and milk
351,Mission Impossible III,7,2,This is the ringing in your ears after you hear me screaming
352,Mission Impossible III,7,3,This is the fact of your eyes with tears in them
353,Mission Impossible III,7,4,And your body naked in the pool
354,Mission Impossible III,7,5,My body is different
355,Mission Impossible III,7,6,My body is made up of a tiny million little pieces of rope
356,Mission Impossible III,7,7,And all I need you to do is tie me up again
357,Mission Impossible III,7,8,I need to move
358,Mission Impossible III,7,9,I want to hear the ideas that leave you
359,Mission Impossible III,7,10,Only just enough room to breathe
360,Mission Impossible III,7,11,This City can hear it all
361,Mission Impossible III,7,12,The lips just want lips
362,Mission Impossible III,7,13,The face just wants to face the mirror and scream
363,Mission Impossible III,7,14,But listen
364,Mission Impossible III,7,15,There's more than enough heartbreak going around
365,Mission Impossible III,7,16,It's all just smoke
366,Mission Impossible III,7,17,The past is dead
367,Mission Impossible III,7,18,And it's not night time yet
368,Mission Impossible III,7,19,We are the birds and we are the stars
369,Mission Impossible III,7,20,We can tell the night to fuck off
370,Mission Impossible III,7,21,I mean look at me
371,Mission Impossible III,7,22,I had the right of way and now I'm dead
372,Mission Impossible III,7,23,How do you think that makes me feel?
373,Mission Impossible III,7,24,They had to stop me.
374,Mission Impossible III,7,25,My mind had started to distort reality
375,Mission Impossible III,7,26,But baby if you don't kill me again I really am going to die.
376,Mission Impossible III,7,27,Just love me.
377,Mission Impossible III,7,28,Who knows?
378,Mission Impossible III,7,29,We might both like it
379,Mission Impossible III,7,30,"Remember, you're nobody till somebody loves you"
380,Mission Impossible III,7,31,And there's no blue without the yellow
381,Mission Impossible III,7,32,Just walk with me
382,Mission Impossible III,7,33,Wild thing
383,Mission Impossible III,7,34,I remember that house
384,Mission Impossible III,7,35,I used to have some stuff in there
385,Mission Impossible III,7,36,"A hill, a medium-sized lake"
386,Mission Impossible III,7,37,"A woman, a gun, various drugs"
387,Mission Impossible III,7,38,Various awards given for excellence in literature
388,Mission Impossible III,7,39,It can't have been that bad if I don't remember anything else
389,Mission Impossible III,7,40,Right?
390,Mission Impossible III,7,41,I can feel it
391,Mission Impossible III,7,42,This heart is about to start beating
392,Mission Impossible III,7,43,High energy resolves into smaller structures
393,Mission Impossible III,7,44,We cannot tile an infinite plane
394,Mission Impossible III,7,45,"Stand back, I stole the fire and I'm about to start smoking"
395,Mission Impossible III,7,46,"I don't talk English, I talk Toyota"
396,Mission Impossible III,7,47,Both when sad and not
397,Mission Impossible III,7,48,In the clown nursery it's always time to dance
398,Mission Impossible III,7,49,We want free drinks and then more free drinks
399,Mission Impossible III,7,50,The apples will speak for themselves
400,Mission Impossible III,7,51,And I wasn't talking to you
401,Mission Impossible III,7,52,"I said stay there, it's fine"
402,Mission Impossible III,7,53,We're all still alive
403,Mission Impossible III,7,54,Who cares what happens after this
404,Mission Impossible III,7,55,The ambassador is on the dance floor
405,Mission Impossible III,7,56,The bride has a headache
406,Mission Impossible III,7,57,And everyone else has their legs in the air
407,Mission Impossible III,7,58,There are things that can be done
408,Mission Impossible III,7,59,"After all, we've all been guilty of a few accidents once in a while"
409,Mission Impossible III,7,60,We walked on water
410,Mission Impossible III,7,61,We was yelling
411,Mission Impossible III,7,62,There was glee
412,Mission Impossible III,7,63,I've spent a little too long squatting naked in the dark
413,Mission Impossible III,7,64,It's taken me a while to get back up above the clouds
414,Mission Impossible III,7,65,And out of the ocean of infinite non-thingness
415,Mission Impossible III,7,66,Now?
416,Mission Impossible III,7,67,Now I just try to be as bad of a person as possible
417,Mission Impossible III,7,68,I have a big debt to pay off
418,Mission Impossible III,7,69,"That's how it works, right?"
419,Mission Impossible III,7,70,My soul is like a factory but all it makes is shit
420,Mission Impossible III,7,71,A place where light is pain
421,Mission Impossible III,7,72,Where my desires fear and my fears desire
422,Mission Impossible III,7,73,My head hurts but I know what I have to do
423,Mission Impossible III,7,74,I know that love is the only thought and pain is the only feeling
424,The Party that Never Ends,8,1,When I was five years old
425,The Party that Never Ends,8,2,I fell off a boat
426,The Party that Never Ends,8,3,In my godmother's lake
427,The Party that Never Ends,8,4,Because I was holding onto the rail too hard
428,The Party that Never Ends,8,5,My older sister says I was underwater
429,The Party that Never Ends,8,6,For only enough time to just about avoid death by drowning
430,The Party that Never Ends,8,7,But I remember sinking
431,The Party that Never Ends,8,8,All the way down to the bottom
432,The Party that Never Ends,8,9,Where I saw creatures I still don't recognize to this day
433,The Party that Never Ends,8,10,Some of them spoke to me
434,The Party that Never Ends,8,11,I don't think I was the same thing I was before
435,The Party that Never Ends,8,12,By the time they pulled me out
436,The Party that Never Ends,8,13,But maybe that's not such a bad thing
437,The Party that Never Ends,8,14,I've realised recently that it doesn't really matter
438,The Party that Never Ends,8,15,"I've been running for a long, long time"
439,The Party that Never Ends,8,16,For years
440,The Party that Never Ends,8,17,I know I can't find what I'm looking for
441,The Party that Never Ends,8,18,And I've wasted so much time
442,The Party that Never Ends,8,19,But I don't regret a thing
443,The Party that Never Ends,8,20,I've changed
444,The Party that Never Ends,8,21,I've done so much
445,The Party that Never Ends,8,22,Seen so much
446,The Party that Never Ends,8,23,I've slept weeping
447,The Party that Never Ends,8,24,And weeping I've waked
448,The Party that Never Ends,8,25,Tears like you wouldn't believe
449,The Party that Never Ends,8,26,But laughter too
450,The Party that Never Ends,8,27,So much laughter
451,The Party that Never Ends,8,28,So much love
452,The Party that Never Ends,8,29,I thought my body was different
453,The Party that Never Ends,8,30,I thought I could never die
454,The Party that Never Ends,8,31,But now I know
455,The Party that Never Ends,8,32,I know the truth
456,The Party that Never Ends,8,33,My head hurts but I know the truth
457,The Party that Never Ends,8,34,I know that love is the only thought
458,The Party that Never Ends,8,35,And pain is the only feeling
459,The Party that Never Ends,8,36,And I'm ready to dance
460,The Party that Never Ends,8,37,I don't know what happened to me
461,The Party that Never Ends,8,38,But I don't really care anymore
462,The Party that Never Ends,8,39,One day I was asleep
463,The Party that Never Ends,8,40,Another awake
464,The Party that Never Ends,8,41,So what?
465,The Party that Never Ends,8,42,All I've ever wanted was to move to the music
466,The Party that Never Ends,8,43,To be at a party that never ended
467,The Party that Never Ends,8,44,They used to chase me with hammers down the street
468,The Party that Never Ends,8,45,Boohoo right?
469,The Party that Never Ends,8,46,But I'm ok
470,The Party that Never Ends,8,47,I would have liked to lose it all with you
471,The Party that Never Ends,8,48,I would have liked to lose myself
472,The Party that Never Ends,8,49,Lose myself the way I used to long ago
473,The Party that Never Ends,8,50,Back when I still had some life left in me
474,The Party that Never Ends,8,51,I would close my eyes
475,The Party that Never Ends,8,52,And be in a great big forest
476,The Party that Never Ends,8,53,Or on an empty beach at sunrise
477,The Party that Never Ends,8,54,Or in some strange and beautiful city
478,The Party that Never Ends,8,55,It's night time but the birds are singing
479,The Party that Never Ends,8,56,The streets are dead
480,The Party that Never Ends,8,57,But they look great in the moonlight
481,The Party that Never Ends,8,58,And I'm just walking along them
482,The Party that Never Ends,8,59,I'm looking for something to love
483,The Party that Never Ends,8,60,But it's not that big a deal
484,The Party that Never Ends,8,61,It's raining
485,The Party that Never Ends,8,62,But I'm alright
486,The Party that Never Ends,8,63,I'm just walking
487,The Party that Never Ends,8,64,I'm ready
488,The Party that Never Ends,8,65,I'm ready to move
489,The Party that Never Ends,8,66,I'll always love you
490,The Party that Never Ends,8,67,But I've got to go now
491,The Party that Never Ends,8,68,They're all waiting for me
492,The Party that Never Ends,8,69,It's been real
493,The Party that Never Ends,8,70,Goodbye
